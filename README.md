# Chat Branches

Injects uuids into chat metadata to form branch trees for current chat. Builds tree based on parent child relationships. You can right click nodes to view messages and click them to jump to that chat/message you can also edit chat names by clicking the pencil icon next to the chat name.

# Requirements

You need the server plugin for it to work, Why? because I have to manipulate the file system to make smarter storage. Blame SillyTavern for their dookie filename chat saving system
[Server plugin](https://github.com/spaceman2408/chat-branches-plugin)

install:
extensions -> install extension -> https://github.com/spaceman2408/chat-branches

I made this for me, and it works for me, if it doesn't work for you just fork and edit.
